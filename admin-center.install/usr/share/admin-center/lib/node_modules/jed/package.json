  "readme": "[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/SlexAxton/Jed.png)](http://travis-ci.org/SlexAxton/Jed)\n\n# Jed\n\n*Gettext Style i18n for Modern JavaScript Apps*\n\nFor more info, please visit the docs site at <http://slexaxton.github.com/Jed>.\n\n## You sure you don't want something more modern?\n\nI also maintain [messageformat.js](https://github.com/SlexAxton/messageformat.js). If you don't specifically need a gettext implementation, I might suggest using MessageFormat instead, as it has better support for plurals/gender and has built-in locale data.\n\n\n## Parsing Gettext Files\n\nJed doesn't include a Gettext file parser, but several third-party parsers exist that can have their output adapted for Jed.\n\n#### Node\n\nJust search the npm repository, there are several PO and MO file parsers available.\n\n#### Browser\n\n[Jed Gettext Parser](https://github.com/WrinklyNinja/jed-gettext-parser) is the only known browser MO file parser, and it also works in Node, and outputs Jed-compatible data directly.\n\n[gettext.js](https://code.google.com/p/gettext-js) and [Pomo.js](https://github.com/cfv1984/pomo) both include browser-compatible PO file parsers.\n\n## Todo\n\n* Build time generation of plural form functions\n* Web interface for building translation sets\n* Code introspection for default values\n\n## License\n\nYou may use this software under the WTFPL.\n\nYou may contribute to this software under the Dojo CLA - <http://dojofoundation.org/about/cla>\n\n\n## Author\n\n* Alex Sexton - @slexaxton - <http://alexsexton.com/>\n\n\n## Credits\n\nA good chunk of sanity checking was done against the gettext.js tests. That was written by:\n\n* Joshua I. Miller\n\nThe sprintf implementation is from:\n\n* Alexandru Marasteanu <alexaholic [at) gmail (dot] com>\n\n\n## The name\n\nThe name jed.js is an homage to Jed Schmidt (<https://github.com/jed>) the JavaScript community member who is a japanese translator by day, and a \"hobbyist\" JavaScript programmer by night. Give your kids three character names and they'll probably get software named after them too.\n",
